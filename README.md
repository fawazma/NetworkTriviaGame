# NetworkTriviaGame

When the game starts, the server will send a question to all the registered players
The first player to send a response to the server is the only one eligible to score points.

## Running the game:
First open the server's terminal and run with:
```
java GameServer
```
Then open two more terminals for the two clients and run with:
```
java MtClient
```
Enjoy!
